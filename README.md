# ExternalDNS - T-Cloud Public DNS Webhook

This is an [ExternalDNS provider](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/master/docs/tutorials/webhook-provider.md) for T-Cloud Public DNS.
It replaces the former in-tree OpenStack Designate provider that never left `Alpha` and was later removed from ExternalDNS (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/pull/5126).
The webhook is already a drop-in replacement for that provider, but it is still evolving. If you find bugs or missing features, please open an issue or send a PR.

## Installation

This webhook provider is run easiest as sidecar within the `external-dns` pod. This can be achieved using the 
[official `external-dns` Helm chart](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/external-dns/latest/charts/external-dns/)
and [its support for the `webhook` provider type](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/external-dns/latest/charts/external-dns/#providers).

Setting the `provider.name` to `webhook` allows configuration of the
`external-dns-t-cloud-public-webhook` via a few additional values:

```yaml
provider:
  name: webhook
  webhook:
    image:
      repository: ghcr.io/opentelekomcloud/external-dns-t-cloud-public-webhook
      tag: 1.0.0
    extraVolumeMounts:
      - name: tcloudpubliccloudsyaml
        mountPath: /etc/t-cloud-public/
    resources: {}
extraVolumes:
  - name: tcloudpubliccloudsyaml
    secret:
      secretName: tcloudpubliccloudsyaml
```

The referenced `extraVolumeMount` points to a `Secret` containing a [`clouds.yaml` file](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/configuration/index.html#clouds-yaml),
which provides the T-Cloud Public IAM credentials to the webhook provider.
`OS_*` environment variables are not supported for configuration, since the use of a `clouds.yaml` file offers more structure, capabilities and allows for better validation.
The one exception to this is `OS_CLOUD` for setting the name of the cloud in `clouds.yaml` to use.

Note: custom TLS settings from `clouds.yaml`, such as `cacert`, `cert`, `key`, or disabled certificate verification, are not explicitly supported by the current webhook auth bootstrap yet. Environments that rely on private trust roots or client-certificate TLS may require a future dedicated implementation.

By default, endpoints are created in public DNS zones. To target a private zone for a specific Kubernetes object, set the provider-specific annotation:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/webhook/zone-type: private
```

Supported values are `public` and `private`. If the annotation is omitted, `public` is used.

The following example is a basic example of a `clouds.yaml` file, using `t-cloud-public` as the cloud name (the default used by this webhook):

```yaml
clouds:
  t-cloud-public:
    auth:
      auth_url: https://iam.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/v3
      user_domain_name: "OTC000000000010000XXXXX"
      project_name: "eu-de_project"
      password: secret
      username: name
    identity_api_version: 3
    region_name: "eu-de"
    interface: "public"
```

An existing file can be converted into a Secret via kubectl:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic tcloudpubliccloudsyaml --namespace external-dns --from-file=clouds.yaml
```

## Bugs or feature requests

This webhook certainly still contains bugs or lacks certain features.
In such cases, please raise a GitHub issue with as much detail as possible. PRs with fixes and features are also very welcome.

## Development

To run the webhook locally, you'll also require a [clouds.yaml](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/pike/configuration/index.html#clouds-yaml) file in one of the standard-locations.
The name of the entry to use must be provided via the `OS_CLOUD` environment variable.
You can then start the webhook server using:

```sh
go run cmd/webhook/main.go
```

Private-zone selection is controlled through endpoint annotations, so the local webhook command is the same for public and private zones.
